# Data-Visualization-and-Descriptive-Statistics
_You are Data Analyst of company X. The data file Home_Values.xlsx contains median values of the following variables: house price (Home Value), household income (Household income - HH Inc), income per capita (Income per capita - Per Cap Inc) and percentage of homes that are owner occupied (Pct Owner Occ ) for each state in the United States (including the District of Columbia). Before diving into more in-depth analysis, your company wants to understand these four variables (e.g. central tendency, variability, shape of the distribution, relationship patterns) between variables). To help the company better understand the data, you are required to perform the following analytical steps:_

1. Calculate the mean, median, range and standard deviation of each variable. Summarize and present the results in a table.

2. Create a frequency histogram for each variable to define the shape of the data mix. Note that each chart should have a title and the axes of the chart should be clearly noted.

3. Create boxplots for each variable. Note that each chart should have a title and the axes of the chart should be clearly noted.

4. Create scatterplots for each variable in relation to 1 other variable (hint: you will need to plot 6 scatterplots). Note that each chart should have a title and the axes of the chart should be clearly noted.

5. Calculate the correlation coefficient of each variable with the other variables. Presented in a table.

_Present (in the form of markdown in Python) your comments from the analysis steps 1-5 above (including the tables and charts prepared in the above steps for the reader's convenience), the comments should include:_

a. Show what the data table obtained in step 1 shows about the concentration and distribution of each variable (the central tendency, variability and distribution of each variable).

b. Showing how the frequency histograms in step 2 and the boxplots in step 3 assist and help clarify the results obtained in step 1. From step 1 and step 2, find outliers for each variable.

c. Show what the scatterplots in step 4 and the correlation coefficients in step 5 represent about the relationship between the pairs of variables (For example, are the variables related?, those relationships appear to be linear? (linear) or nonlinear?, are those relationships positive or negative?

d. Of the variables HH Inc , Per Cap Inc and Pct Owner Occ, which one has the strongest relationship with Home Value?
